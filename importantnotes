1. Scala has only a handful of built-in control structures. The only control structures are if, while, for, try, match, 
and function calls.

2. Scala adopts this ternary operator model

3. Scala then continues this trend by having for, try, and match also result in values.

4. Scala’s basic control structures, minimal as they are, are sufficient to provide all of the essentials from imperative languages.

One difference from Java that you’ll quickly notice in Scala is that unlike Java, Scala does not require you to catch checked 
exceptions, or declare them in a throws clause. You can declare a throws clause if you wish with the @throws annotation,
